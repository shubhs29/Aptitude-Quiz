    question: "2 Men and 3 Women can complete a piece of work in 15 days. In how many days will 6 Men and 9 Women be able to complete the same work?",
    options: ["5 Days", "10 Days", "15 Days", "45 Days"],
    correctAnswer: "5 Days",
    explanation: "Shortcut: The workforce is tripled (3x). Since work is inversely proportional to workers, Time = 15 / 3 = 5 days.",

    category: "Time & Work",
    question: "6 Men and 8 Women can complete a work in 10 days. How many days will it take for 15 Men and 20 Women to complete the same work?",
    options: ["2 Days", "4 Days", "5 Days", "8 Days"],
    correctAnswer: "4 Days",
    explanation: "Shortcut: Both Men (6 to 15) and Women (8 to 20) are multiplied by 2.5. Time = 10 / 2.5 = 4 days.",

    options: ["27 Years", "33 Years", "40 Years", "41 Years"],
    correctAnswer: "33 Years",
    explanation: "Shortcut: A's age must be a multiple of 3. Subtract 9 from options: 33-9=24 (multiple of 12), 27-9=18 (not multiple of 12). Thus 33 is correct.",
  },

    id: 4,
    category: "Ages",
    question: "The present age ratio of mother and daughter is 7:1. 4 years ago, it was 19:1. What will be the mother's age 4 years from now?",
    options: ["38 Years", "42 Years", "46 Years", "36 Years"],
    correctAnswer: "46 Years",
    explanation: "Shortcut: (Age - 4) must be a multiple of 7. 46-4=42 (Multiple of 7). Testing 42: 4 years ago was 38 (19x2), daughter was 2 (1x2). Mother's present age is 42, so 4 years from now is 46.",

    options: ["0", "1", "25", "50"],
    correctAnswer: "0",
    explanation: "Shortcut: The numerator contains factors 5 (from 55), 5 (from 85), and 4 (from 96). 5*5*4 = 100. Since 100 is a factor, remainder is 0.",

    question: "A sum of money doubles itself in 3 years at a certain rate of interest. In how many years will it become 16 times of itself?",
    options: ["9 Years", "12 Years", "15 Years", "18 Years"],
    correctAnswer: "12 Years",
    explanation: "Shortcut: 16 is 2^4. If it takes 3 years to double (2^1), it takes 4 * 3 = 12 years to reach 16x (2^4).",

    question: "A dishonest shopkeeper marks his goods at 20% profit but gives only 900g instead of 1kg. What is his actual profit percentage?",
    options: ["20%", "25%", "33.33%", "30%"],
    correctAnswer: "33.33%",
    explanation: "Shortcut: Price for 1kg is 120. But he gives 900g (Cost 90). Profit = 30 on 90. (30/90) * 100 = 33.33%.",

    question: "A shopkeeper sells his goods at Cost Price but uses a weight of 920g for a kg. What is his profit percentage?",
    options: ["8%", "8.69%", "9.2%", "7.5%"],
    correctAnswer: "8.69%",
    explanation: "Shortcut: Profit = (Error / True Value - Error) * 100. Profit = (80 / 920) * 100 = 8.69%.",

    options: ["300", "348", "400", "320"],
    correctAnswer: "348",
    explanation: "Shortcut: Efficiency LCM=720. A+B=20, B+R=24, R+A=15. 2(A+B+R)=59. Efficiency A=5.5, B=14.5, R=9.5. Work = (4*5.5)+(8*14.5)+(8*9.5) = 22+116+76. Wait, following video efficiency: A=27, B=9, R=21 leads to 348.",
